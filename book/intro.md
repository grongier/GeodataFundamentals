# Welcome to Geodata Fundamentals

Geodata Fundamentals is a course taken by the first year students of the bachelor's degree program *Earth, Climate and Technology* (EC&T) at the Civil Engineering and Geosciences faculty of Delft University of Technology.

It brings together knowledge of geophysics and remote sensing, of statistics, and of computer science to lay the foundations for the learning line *Earth System Data*. Through practical examples, it covers the basic principles behind making informed decisions under uncertainty to manage subsurface resources, mitigate geohazards, or predict future weather and climate, among other applications.
